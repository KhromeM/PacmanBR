**Game Mechanics:**<br/>
<br/>
Eat dots to increase your score
<br/>
WASD to move, spacebar to stop movement
<br/>
Aviod the ghost and the other pacman
<br/>
If you have a higher score than the rival pacman, you can eat him and win the game
<br/>

<br/>

**To play:**<br/>
<br/>
https://restartgame.glitch.me/ (to reset the database)
<br/>
https://pacmanbr.glitch.me/ (the actual game)
<br/>
Both players should try to join at the same time for a fair game.
<br/>

<br/>


**How it works:**<br/>
<br/>
Uses Google Firestore to enable multiplayer
<br/>
The ghost uses the A* path finding algorithim to locate the shortest path to pacman
<br/>
The p5.js libary to draw and animate the game
<br/>
The p5 2d collisions libary is  used for collision detection.
